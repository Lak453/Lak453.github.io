Recently, Harry Potter has been quite popular again. I first came across "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" on a colleague's social media, and then noticed "Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban" mentioned in another friend's post.

Soon, I found myself diving into the other books in the series, unable to stop reading. I envy those who can craft intricate metaphors and write beautifully, convinced that they possess an unseen, fascinating world within them. So, I tried to glimpse the essence of writing through J.K. Rowling's words, but ultimately, I only saw the barrenness within myself. Without meticulous observation and experience of life, how can one write splendid prose? Not to mention writing, it seems that even my memories of different life stages have become fragmented, unable to form a complete picture. Thinking about this, I wish I had consistently recorded my life and thoughts... Some things, once lost, can never be recovered.

When reading her work, corresponding scenes always vividly appear in my mind. Everything is so serene, everything happens so naturally, evoking a bit of envy and some longing. But I know that imagination is always romantic and tends to downplay hardships. If I were living that life, amidst vast meadows and deep forests, possibly not seeing a single soul all day, everything before me would be as still as a painting, with only the mountain breeze and the clouds bringing any change. Just thinking about it feels like an endless solitude—could I truly find joy in it?

Reading her descriptions always feels fresh. Different landscapes, different customs, different people. It makes me realize that sometimes I feel trapped in a monotonous routine, with not much new happening in life. If the first half of my life was spent battling poverty, the latter half seems to be more about fighting the barrenness within.

I once read a theory that as we age, time seems to pass more quickly because our brains, fundamentally prediction machines, tend to focus on and remember novel and surprising things. If a day is filled with many new experiences, it will feel rich in retrospect, with many time fragments. Conversely, if the day is monotonous, few memory points will remain.

Is this important? Not really—someone at peace with themselves can find joy anywhere. But it is important too, as we can combat the swift passage of time by bravely immersing ourselves in the unknown and seeking new challenges.

It's too early to say that J.K. Rowling's writing has cured my mental fatigue, but I faintly feel that during the reading process, I am gradually being infused with a strength—a strength that reminds me to focus on the present. This strength is something that many philosophies and psychology books have tried to teach me, but ultimately, it's something I must understand on my own.

PS: Sometimes I think I'm a bit sentimental, but anyone who wants to write must have a bit of sentimentality, right? Otherwise, what's the big deal? What's worth writing about? In the end, there would be nothing to write down. I accept that I have a bit of this sentimentality.
